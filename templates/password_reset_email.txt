Hi {{ user.get_first_name|default:"there" }},

We received a request to reset your Tottable password. You can do that by clicking the link below:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

This link will expire soon for security reasons. If you didn’t request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email — your password will stay the same.

Thanks,  
The Tottable Team
