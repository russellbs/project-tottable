“BABY OATMEAL
				MAKES ABOUT ½ CUP
				Oats are a great grain to start with because they are naturally high in iron. You can process rolled oats (not quick-cooking or instant) into a fine powder in the blender or food processor for a smooth fiber- and mineral-rich baby cereal that you can mix with fruit or vegetable puree as baby is introduced to more foods.
				
					¼ cup rolled oats
					⅔ cup water
				
				Put the oats in a blender or food processor and process to a fine powder.
				Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in the oatmeal powder and lower the heat. Cook, stirring continually, until the water is absorbed and the cereal is thickened and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. (If it’s too thick, thin with a little cool water, breast milk, or formula.) Let it cool to room temperature before feeding baby.
				Make ahead: Process a few cups of oats at a time and store the powder in a jar so that you can quickly cook individual portions. For toddlers and older kids, you can process the powder a little more coarsely and use this instead of quick-cooking oats, “which often have lots of added sugar”

“BABY BARLEY CEREAL
				MAKES ABOUT ¾ CUP
				Barley is an iron-rich, nutty-tasting grain packed with fiber and a variety of other important nutrients. It is a nice change from rice cereal or oats, and it pairs deliciously with savory foods like veggies or Zucchini-Pea Puree with Mint (this page). Use a powerful blender to grind the dry barley into a fine powder.
				
					¼ cup pearled barley
					1 cup water
				
				Put the dry barley in a blender or food processor and process to a fine powder, 3 to 4 minutes.
				Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in the barley powder and lower the heat. Cook, stirring continually, until the mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. (If it’s too thick, thin with a little cool water, breast milk, or formula.) Let it cool to room temperature before feeding baby.
				Make ahead: You can grind up a few cups of the barley powder in small batches and store it in a jar in the refrigerator so that you can cook single servings of cereal quickly. When you want to prepare a serving, use 1 part barley powder to 3 parts water.”

“ZUCCHINI-PEA PUREE WITH MINT
				MAKES ABOUT 1½ CUPS
				Make baby’s first blend a nutritional powerhouse! Lightened up with summer squash (zucchini), sweet green peas make an iron-, folate-, and vitamins C and K–rich puree for baby. A brief steaming preserves the vegetables’ nutrients and bright color.
				
					1 medium zucchini, washed and ends trimmed
					1 fresh mint leaf
					1 cup fresh or frozen sweet green peas
				
				Slice the zucchini into 1-inch rounds. Tear the stem and center rib from the mint leaf.
				Bring an inch or so of water to a boil in a pan fitted with a steamer. Place the zucchini in the steamer, cover, and steam until tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a food processor.
				Place the peas in the steamer, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 6 minutes for fresh and about 2 minutes for frozen. Spoon the peas into the bowl of the food processor. Let the vegetables cool to room temperature.
				Add the mint leaf to the vegetables and process to a smooth puree, adding a few tablespoons of water as necessary to get a smooth consistency before feeding baby.
				To store: Refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months.”

“SMOOTH SWEET POTATO PUREE
				MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP
				Sweet potatoes are packed with healthy carbohydrates, as well as vitamins A, B6, and C. Their naturally sweet flavor and creamy texture make them an appealing early choice for baby. Once baby gets used to the flavor of sweet potatoes on their own, mix sweet potato puree with a little apple or pear puree.
				Bake several sweet potatoes at once so that you (and the rest of the family) can enjoy them for lunch or dinner, too. (For adults and older kids, try them sliced lengthwise and topped with black beans, salsa, a spoonful of yogurt, and a squeeze of lime.)
				
					One 8- to 12-ounce sweet potato
				
				Preheat the oven to 400°F.
                “Scrub the sweet potato well with a vegetable brush under running water. Prick in several places with a sharp paring knife, then place on a baking sheet or pan. Bake until very soft when you pierce it with a knife, 45 to 60 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
				Slice the sweet potato in half lengthwise, scoop the cooked potato from the skin, and place in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth; add a little water as necessary to get a smooth consistency. (Discard the skin or, since it is so nutritious, you may want to use as shells to stuff for an older kid or an adult.)
				When baby is ready to handle a little more texture, you can mash the sweet potato coarsely with a fork, and eventually graduate to offering her small soft pieces to feed herself.
                
                
                To store: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months.”

“APPLE-PEAR PUREE
				MAKES ABOUT 2½ CUPS
				Apple-pear sauce is full of healthy carbohydrates and vitamin C, and it’s sweet and easy on the tummy. Mix it with a little rice cereal, baby oatmeal, or barley cereal for variety.
				
					1½ pounds pears
					1½ pounds apples
				
				Peel and core the pears and apples and cut them into 1-inch chunks.
				Bring an inch or so of water to a boil in a pan fitted with a steamer. Place the chunks in the steamer, cover and steam until the fruit is very soft when you pierce it with a knife, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool.
				Transfer the fruit to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth, adding a few tablespoons of water as necessary to get the right texture.
				To store: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months.

“BANANA MASH
				MAKES ABOUT ½ CUP
				Naturally sweet and creamy, and conveniently portable, bananas are an ideal choice for one of baby’s first foods. They’re packed with potassium and carbohydrates and C and B vitamins. Choose ripe bananas; they’re sweeter and softer to mash. As baby grows, you can make this puree chunkier; eventually you can give baby small cubes of banana. Banana mash doesn’t store well, so make small batches for baby to eat that day.
				
					1 ripe banana
				
				Peel the banana and break into chunks. Place in a bowl and mash well with a fork. Add water if needed to thin the mixture to the right consistency before feeding baby.”

“CARROT-CHICKPEA MASH WITH CUMIN
				MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP
				Chickpeas are a super-legume: they’re packed with healthy carbohydrates, folate, protein, and iron. Blending chickpeas with carrot is a nice way to introduce baby to their mellow, nutty flavor. When baby is old enough for dipping pita triangles, this mixture will make a great dip brightened up with a spoonful of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.
				
					2 small carrots, peeled and cut into ¼-inch rounds
					½ cup drained canned or cooked dried chickpeas
					⅛ teaspoon cumin
				
				Bring several inches of water to a boil in a pan fitted with a steamer. Place the carrots in the steamer, cover, and steam until they are very soft when you pierce them with a knife, about 10 minutes. Let cool.
				Combine the carrots, chickpeas, and cumin in a blender or food processor and pulse to a smooth puree. Add a few tablespoons of water as needed to get the right consistency before feeding baby.
				To store: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months.”

“CANTALOUPE-NECTARINE PUREE
				MAKES ABOUT 1½ CUPS
				Summer brings an abundance of fresh fruits with plenty of vitamins A and C, like nectarines and sweet cantaloupe. Make this tangy fruit puree in the peak of the season when fresh nectarines and cantaloupe are sweet and juicy. Substitute peaches or plums for nectarines, if you have them. Sweet honeydew melon and tart kiwi fruit are another good combination; the kiwi can be peeled and pureed without steaming.
				
					1 ripe nectarine, halved and pitted
					1 cup cubed cantaloupe
				
				Bring about an inch of water to a boil in a pan fitted with a steamer. Place the nectarine in the steamer, cover, and steam until the fruit is soft when you pierce it with a knife and the skins are loose, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool. Remove the skin with a sharp paring knife.
				Place the nectarine and cantaloupe in a blender or food processor. Process until smooth before feeding baby.
				To store: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months.

“MANGO-BANANA PUREE
				MAKES ABOUT ¾ CUP
				Sweet juicy mango is likely to be one of baby’s early favorite fruits. This smooth, tropical blend offers baby vitamin A, along with potassium, fiber, and vitamins C and B6. Look for mangoes that are heavy for their size and fragrant and yield to gentle pressure. Banana puree doesn’t store well, so make small batches for baby to eat that day.
				
					½ ripe mango
					½ ripe banana
				
				Peel, pit, and cube the mango. Peel and slice the banana. Place in a blender or food processor. Process until smooth, adding a little water as needed to get the right consistency before feeding baby.

“BUTTERNUT SQUASH PUREE
				MAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS
				Orange-fleshed winter squashes, including butternut, are naturally sweet and full of vitamin A and important antioxidants. But don’t stop at butternut! Other good choices are the green-skinned Japanese pumpkin, kabocha, and its reddish-orange cousin, kuri squash. All have dense, sweet flesh that makes a smooth, versatile puree. Avoid your typical American jack-o’-lantern pumpkin, as most varieties are watery and stringy. Also, canned pumpkin puree is very highly processed, and it is much tastier to prepare your own with a delicious winter squash.
				
					1 winter squash (about 1½ pounds)
				
				Preheat the oven to 375°F.
				Using a large sharp knife, cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and place the halves cut-side down in a baking pan. Add about ½ inch of water to the pan and cover with aluminum foil.
				Bake until the squash is very soft when you pierce it with a knife, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool completely. Scoop out the flesh from the rind and transfer to a blender or food processor. Process until smooth before feeding baby.
				To store: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months”

“MASHED KABOCHA SQUASH WITH PEAR AND CINNAMON
				MAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS
				Pear and winter squash make a hearty pairing that’s packed with vitamins A and C and fiber.
				
					1 small kabocha squash
					1½ pounds pears
					⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
				
				Preheat the oven to 375°F.
				Using a large sharp knife, cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and place the halves cut-side down in a baking pan. Add about a ½ inch of water to the pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
				Bake until the squash is very soft when you pierce it with a knife, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool completely.
				Meanwhile, peel and core the pears and cut them into 1-inch chunks.
                “Bring several inches of water to a boil in a pan fitted with a steamer. Place the pears in the steamer, cover, and steam until the fruit is very soft when you pierce it with a knife, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool completely.
				Scoop out the squash flesh from the rind. Place the squash and pears in a blender or food processor with the cinnamon. Process until smooth, adding a few tablespoons of water as necessary to get the right consistency before feeding baby.
				To store: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze individual portions for up to 3 months.
